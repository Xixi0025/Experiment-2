        <h2>The Power of Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>
          Different programming languages serve different purposes in the tech ecosystem. Python excels in data science and AI, JavaScript dominates web development, while languages like Rust and Go are pushing the boundaries of system programming and performance optimization.
        </p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Focus on mastering one language deeply before exploring others. Understanding core programming concepts is more valuable than knowing syntax of multiple languages superficially.
